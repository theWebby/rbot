## What is OCRX?

OCRX Node enables developers to add OCR capabilities to their applications.

- **Text or PDF output** - recognize text from BMP files and convert to searchable text or multiple-page PDF files.
- **Structured Results** - results are organized in a hierarchical model were every character is tied to a word, text line, text block, region, and page.
- **Languages** - recognize text in over 30 different languages.
- **Simple** - by providing only a minimal asynchronous API, OCRX is easy to learn. With a few lines of code, recognize text found in images produced by scanners, cameras, or fax machines.
## OCR with less than 20 lines of code 

  1. Make sure you have the following system requirements:
      
###### Linux *64 bit*

   - `node -v` x64 4.0 or greater and npm.
   - `gcc --version` 4.8.1 or greater.
   - `g++ -v` 4.8.1 or greater.
   - `java -version` x64 JRE 1.7 or later.

###### Windows *64 bit*

   - `node -v` x64 4.0 or greater and npm.
   - `java -version` x64 JRE 1.7 or later.
   - `python -V` 2.7.x
   - `[Visual C++ Build Tools.](http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools)

2. Set node build tools *(Windows only)*
   
  - `npm config set python python2.7`
  - `npm config set msvs_version 2015`

3. Register an email address for a [free account](https://www.accusoft.com/products/ocr-xpress/get-it/) to get access to our OCRX evaluation version
4. `npm install ocr` 
5. Run the license utility to install an evaluation license. When prompted enter the email you registered with in step 2: 
  - to launch window: 
	  `cd node_modules/ocr && npm run register`
 - to register manually: 
	   `cd node_modules/ocr && npm run register -- youremail@domain.com ` 
6. Use the following to get a taste of what OCRX can do:

```js
var ocr = require('ocr');

// Set default values. 
var params = {
    input: './node_modules/ocr/samples/images/color.bmp',
    output: './out.txt',
	format: 'text'
};
    
// OCR the input image and output result to text file given by params.output
ocr.recognize(params, function(err, document){
    if(err)
        console.error(err);
    else{        
        //output the document object: 
        console.log(document); 
    }
});
```
## Accessing Results
The Results Manager is a collection of *"get"* functions that returns an array of various result *objects*.

For example, to get the text of the first word recognized in the document:
```js
var textLine = document.getWords()[0].text;
```
Resulting objects return more than just text. The following provides access to characters, words, and the bounding box of the first line of text, inside the first region of text recognized in the document:
```js
var textLine = document.getRegions()[0].getTextLines()[0];
```
It is also possible to control the output of the result by adjusting recognition parameters. For example,
```js
var params = {
    output: './out.pdf',
    format: 'pdf'
};
```
There are many other OCR capabilities such as page rotation, multiple supported languages, recognition confidence, and much more.
